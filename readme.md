# redis-utils

## install

```bash
npm install redis-utils
```

## api

```js
var ru = require('redis-utils')
```

### server(config, callback)

```js
ru.server({
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 6379,
  password: 'root'
}, function (e) {
  if(e) throw e
  console.log('redis server is running')
})
```


 * If the `redis-server` is already running in the specified port and host it will not spawn a new process.
 * When the process exits, the `redis-server` will also exit - unless it was already running.
 * The password is used to connect the server in order to ensure it is running.

Alternatively you can pass the `redis.conf` path in the opts.

```js
ru.server({
  conf: 'path/to/redis.conf'
})
```

### client(config, callback)

The config options are the same as `.server()`

```js
ru.client({
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 6379
}, function (e, client) {
  if(e) throw e
})
```

### pubsub(config, cbs, evs, callback)

```js

var on = {
  ev1: function (message) {},
  ev2: function (message) {}
}


ru.pubsub({
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 6379
}, on, ['ev2', 'ev2'])
```
